24 Hr Challange (accumative)
Aim: To make a game based on the Atari Jaguar game 'Down Fall' using only Javascript and HTML5 Canvas, an IDE that doesn't have code completion (Notepad ++) and the internet for reference.  Additional libraries and frameworks are not aloud.

2 hrs 
Started by creating a basic sketleton layout with vector graphics by using the basic move and line to, a gradient fill background and scoreboard.  A basic player object was create containing draw and basic left / right movement controlled by the keyboard.  Also a simple platform object was create containing draw methods.  The start of the main game loop was added to draw everything to screen.

3 hr
Added platform collison method and player drop method to allow player to drop and land on a static platform.  Player will wrap if the sprite leaves the far right / left and bottom of screen. Added collison detection to the platform object so player can collide and stand on the platform.  Next I moved onto dealing with multiple platforms and decide by adding a class to handle platform spawing (at the moment just two) and stores them within an array.  It also deals with player collisons of each platform which now allows the player collison with any of the platforms.  Last minute additions methods to deal with platform movement with wrap around and making sure the player stays on the platform that it has collided with whilst the platform is moving.  

4 hr 
Added a simple title and game over screen and implemented scoring logic.  The scoring is based on the amount of time the player stays on screen.  Providing the player doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen the score is increment.  If the highscore is reach the highscore is adjusted.  If the player falls off the bottom or disapears off the top of the screen when riding a platform then the game over screen is shown.  The player hits any key to move back to the title screen and again to start the game with their score reset to zero by the highscore maintained.  Finished off with a quick refactor of some of the code.
